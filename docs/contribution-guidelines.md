# Contributing to Inventrack Pro

This project is currently maintained by **Manjunath R**. As the sole contributor, I welcome contributions, bug reports, or feature requests via GitHub issues or pull requests.

## How to Contribute

### 1. Fork the Repository

Fork the repository to your own GitHub account.

### 2. Clone the Fork

Clone your fork locally:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/manju1807/inventrackpro.git
```

### 3. Create a Branch

It's a best practice to create a new branch for each feature or bug fix. This keeps the changes isolated and makes it easier to manage pull requests.

```bash
git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
```

*Replace `your-feature-name` with a descriptive name for the feature or fix you're working on (e.g., `feature/add-login-page` or `bugfix/fix-navbar-bug`).*

### 4. Make Changes

Implement the changes or add the new feature. You can make multiple commits if needed. Always try to break your changes into logical commits with clear messages.

### 5. Commit Your Changes

Once you're happy with the changes, commit them with a meaningful message. Use a consistent and clear commit message format that follows the conventional commit guidelines.

Example commit message formats:

* `feat: add user authentication feature`
* `fix: resolve issue with login form validation`
* `docs: update README with new setup instructions`

To commit your changes, use the following commands:

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "feat: add user authentication feature"
```

### 6. Push Your Branch

Push your changes to the corresponding branch on your forked repository:

```bash
git push origin feature/your-feature-name
```

### 7. Create a Pull Request (PR)

1. Go to your fork on GitHub and click the "Compare & Pull Request" button
2. Provide a clear description of the changes made and any relevant context
3. If you're fixing a bug or implementing a feature, mention the issue number if applicable

Once your PR is ready, submit it for review. I will review and merge it if everything looks good!

## Commit Message Guidelines

Please use the following guidelines for your commit messages:

* **type**: Use one of the predefined types (e.g., feat, fix, docs, chore, etc.)
* **subject**: A short summary of the change in present tense (e.g., "Add new login feature")

Example commit message:

```bash
git commit -m "feat: add new login feature"
```

### Common commit types

* `feat`: A new feature
* `fix`: A bug fix
* `docs`: Documentation updates
* `style`: Code style changes (e.g., formatting, whitespace)
* `refactor`: Code changes that neither fix a bug nor add a feature
* `test`: Adding or modifying tests
* `chore`: Routine tasks like updating dependencies, build process, etc.

Thank you for your interest in contributing to the project!
